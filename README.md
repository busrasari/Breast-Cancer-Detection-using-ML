# Machine-Learning-Project
This project is built for a class named INF502 (Machine Learning) in the Turkish German University. I have applied the Machine Learning approach of varius algorithms to classify the tumor cells as benign or malignant on the Breast Cancer database.

Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
## ML Models Used
* k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Random Forest (RF)
* Support Vector Machine ( SVM)
* Logistic Regression (LR)
