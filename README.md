# Machine-Learning-Project
This project is built for a class named INF502 (Machine Learning) in the Turkish German University. I have applied the Machine Learning approach of varius algorithms to classify the tumor cells as benign or malignant on the Breast Cancer database.
## Algorithms Used
k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Random Forest (RF)
Support Vector Machine ( SVM)
Logistic Regression (LR)
